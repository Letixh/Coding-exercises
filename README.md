# Coding-exercises
I'm a student who just started learning python and wanted a place where I can upload my coding exercises from class just incase I lose my computer or can't acess it. As well as a place I can easily find all my work in one place.
There is one file which is a homework that I did. As it was a freestyle, I am making it public and all my other homeworks will remain private.
