# Coding-exercises
I'm a student who just started learning python and wanted a place where I can upload my coding exercises from class just in case I lose my computer or can't access it, as a place I can easily find all my work in one place. As well as being a place I can track my progress.
There is one file which is a homework that I did. As it was a freestyle, I am making it public, and all my other homework will remain private.
